# Finance-Projects-Python-

Hello! I am Brian, an undergraduate student majoring in quantitative finance (QFIN) in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

This folder is created to store my projects about financial analysis with python, including portfolio management, alternative data mining, and quantitative trading codes.

In file:
Beginner file includes less advanced codes, all created before the beginning of my sophomore year, mostly regarding simple computations and visualizations in finance.
  
Intermediate file includes medium level codes related to more rigorous mathematical and python   analysis in quantitative finance, such as data mining, derivatives, and simulations.

Advanced file includes advanced quantitative finance codes related to machine learning, risk management, and trading.

Thank you for viewing!
